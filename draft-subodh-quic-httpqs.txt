Abstract

   This document specifies a URL scheme "httpqs" for a browser to

1.  Introduction

   A browser can discover that a particular HTTP resource is available
   via QUIC via Alt-Svc.  However, in some cases it is difficult to use
   Alt-Svc to discover the use of QUIC:

   o  A website will want to experiment with QUIC before enabling QUIC
      for CDN use cases.  One desired model of experimentation is at a
      per-user level where a website decides whether to assign a user to
      a test or control group.  A CDN typically does not have access to
      cookies which determine users.  Thus to run such an experiment,
      additional co-operation between the website and the CDN would be
      needed.  If the website decides that the user should use QUIC, it
      cannot normally supply an Alt-Svc for the CDN.  The website
      instead needs to provide a hint to the CDN that it wishes to use
      QUIC for the resource and and the CDN would then supply the Alt-
      Svc itself.  This process requires an additional round-trip to
      discover the use of QUIC and makes experiments more complex.

   o  A particular origin might not be requested frequently in one
      browser session.  For example, it is common for a CDN to cache
      different content types in different server locations and refer to
      each location with a different URL.  Once a client requests an
      HTTP resource over the network, it might not request it again over
      the network, because subsequent tries might receive a cached
      response.  If there are not many requests per origin, then
      discovering than an origin can use QUIC might be too late.

   To help make experimentation easier, we propose a new URL scheme for
   QUIC "httpqs:".  Unlike Alt-Svc, "httpqs:" is limited in
   functionality and specifies that the server makes the same resource
   available over both HTTPS over TCP, as well as HTTP over QUIC at the
   same IP address and port.  Alt-Svc scopes the use of an entire
   origin, but "httpqs:" only defines what happens to that particular
   resource.

Internet-Draft        An httpqs URL scheme for QUIC            July 2018


2.  Server and client behaviors

2.1.  Server Behavior

   Websites that use CDNs that support QUIC deployments which support a
   deployment where QUIC and TCP run on the same IP can send "httpqs"
   URLs wherever a "https" scheme could have been used.

2.2.  Client Behavior

   When a browser sees a URL to a resource with the scheme "httpqs", if
   it does not have a cached connection for QUIC or TCP, it SHOULD race
   both a HTTP over QUIC and a HTTPS connection as soon as it has an IP
   address for the hostname to connect to.  The specific policy of
   racing connections and the tradeoffs between using pooled connections
   versus opening new connections are out of scope of this document.

   It is possible that the browser already has an Alt-Svc setting
   available on the origin of the "httpqs" resource.  In this case,
   browsers MUST give "httpqs" a higher precedence, as it is a more
   specific marker.  A browser MAY reuse a pooled connection which was
   created as a result of connecting to an Alt-Svc, provided that the
   origin of the "httpqs" URL matches the original service of the Alt-
   Svc.

2.3.  QUIC transport negotiation

   Alt-Svc allows specific QUIC versions as well as ALPNs to be provided
   as hints to reduce round trips during connection establishment.
   "httpqs" follows the default transport parameter negotiation as if no
   version was specified as a hint even if an Alt-Svc value is available
   for the origin of the resource.

3.  Load balancing considerations

   CDNs might want to balance load differently between QUIC and TCP.
   "httpqs" may limit the ability to do so as it is a commitment to
   support both HTTP over QUIC and HTTPS over the same IP and port.  If
   a CDN wants to stop supporting QUIC it has several options:

   o  Stop listening on a QUIC port at the IP.  Browsers should fallback
      to TCP at that point.

   o  Advertise a Version negotiation packet with an invalid version
      which is not supported.

4.  Security Considerations

   For the browser security model "httpqs" schemes should be treated the
   same as "https" URLs for same origin checks.
